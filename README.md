# Horus
## Capable Garry's Mod moderation for the modern era

Horus is a heavily WIP moderation mod, designed for use in the [Fluffy Servers](https://fluffyservers.com) network.

Most of this README is only planned stuff - but we're further into development than you may think!

Horus is strongly inspired by [Maestro](https://github.com/ottworks/maestro) - the aim is for most commands to have similar or identical functionality to their Maestro counterparts.

## Design
### Philosophy
- Database driven: load almost everything from SQL, with local fallbacks if something goes wrong
- Lightweight and invisible: a good moderation mod shouldn't be known to the average citizen
- Notes are a first class citizen: knowledge is power
- Cover everything essential: spraytracking, screengrabbing etc. from the start

### Features

  - Moderators can take notes on players for review later
